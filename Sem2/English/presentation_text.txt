1(Pavel): Hello, today our team would like to describe theme "How to earn money as a professional blogger"
2(Artem): When we saw the list of topics, we thought for a long time about which one to choose
3(Vlad): So, we chose this topic because it is very actual nowadays. At the moment, the blogger format is one of the most popular formats on the Internet. For example, if you log on to the youtube platform, most likely a large amount of content from bloggers will be recommended to you on the main page
4(Michael): On this slide you can see the outline of our presentation, basically we will try to tell you about different methods of successful blogging. At the end of the presentation, we will answer your questions
5(Pavel): Okay, let's start. Firstly let's figure out who a professional blogger is. Nowaday's blogger isn't just a hobby, it also a full-fledged profession. You need to spend a lot of time creating content, communicating with the audience, and learning new skills. Also, if you are a popular blogger, then your public behavior should match your image. So, a professional blogger is a person for whom blogging is the main job, which he spends a lot of time on, and which brings him the main income
6(Artem): The first method is an advertising contract with the company. In your content, you actively advertise the goods or services of a particular company, for which you are paid money. This is usually a good income, but to sign a contract, you need the company to be interested in you, and for this you need to already have a good audience #1 пример такого блогера#
7(Vlad): The second method is to connect to monetization on streaming services. If you already have a large audience, then you can connect the monetization system. The platform on which you upload your content will insert its ads into your material, and you will receive money for the number of ad views. Unfortunately. In the last few years, many platforms have refused to monetize Russian bloggers.
